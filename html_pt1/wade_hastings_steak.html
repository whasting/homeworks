    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

      <p>Ahh, yes. Steak. A dish that has stood the test of time. Arguably one of the most important foods known to man. I once heard in my basic anthropology class that scientists believe we developed the incredible and complex concept of spoken language via sitting around and cooking the day's kill. Today, we leard how to broil a New York strip steak.</p>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steak">Here's some more info on steak.</a>
    <a name="ingredients"></a>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
      <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A fresh or defrosted cut of beef known as a New York Strip</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>An oven and a broiling pan</li>
      </ul>
    <a name="directions"></a>
    <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Begin preheating your oven's broiler for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>While the broiler is preheating, take your steak and pat it dry</li>
        <li>Line your broiling pan with foil to prevent scorching the pan and to facilitate easy cleanup</li>
        <li>Salt your steak on both sides and place on your broiling pan</li>
        <li>Once your broiler has finished heating up, place your broiling pan and steak inside the oven</li>
        <li>Refer to <a href="http://www.omahasteaks.com/servlet/OnlineShopping?Dsp=32&FID=recipe_cookchart">this steak cooking chart</a> to see how long you should broil your steak for.</li>
        <li>NOTE: Using this method, I recommend placing the steak 6 inches away from the heating element. If this is your first time broiling, sit and watch the steak cook! Flareups can and will ruin your steak! It will also smoke you out and not in a good way!</li>
      </ol>
